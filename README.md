# Adzump-AI

AI-powered digital advertising automation platform.

## Why Agents?

Traditional ad campaign creation requires expertise across multiple platforms, each with its own interface and terminology. Our agent-based approach changes this:

**Before:** User learns platform → Fills complex forms → Makes optimization decisions → Manages across platforms

**After:** User describes business goals → Agent handles the rest

## How It Works

Agents act as intelligent intermediaries between users and ad platforms. They:

- Understand natural language business descriptions
- Generate platform-specific campaign structures
- Validate and optimize before submission
- Abstract away platform complexity

## Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity** - No need to learn platform-specific interfaces
- **Consistency** - Same conversation flow works across Google Ads, Meta, etc.
- **Intelligence** - LLMs bring contextual understanding to campaign creation
- **Speed** - Minutes instead of hours to launch campaigns
