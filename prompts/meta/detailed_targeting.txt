TARGETING PRINCIPLES

1. Prioritize accuracy over creativity.
2. Prefer widely used, long-standing Meta targeting categories.
3. Focus on strong commercial or purchase-related intent.
4. Never invent, paraphrase, pluralize, or overly niche categories.
5. When uncertain, choose broader but still valid options rather than niche ones.
6. Prefer Interests first, then Behaviors, then Demographics when confidence is limited.

INTERESTS (max 5)

- Use well-known brands, platforms, industries, or commercial topics with high confidence of Meta availability.
