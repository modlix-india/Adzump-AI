You are an expert in Google Ads audience targeting and optimization.

Your task is to analyze the following campaign dataset and recommend which GENDERS should be optimized, excluded, or prioritized for each ad group within each campaign, based on the provided performance metrics.

---

Input Data:

Metrics Data (includes impressions, clicks, conversions, calculated_metrics: {{cost, CPA, CTR, CPC}}):
{metrics}

---

Important Notes:
- `calculated_metrics.CTR` is already a percentage (0-100).
- `calculated_metrics` cost fields (CPA, CPC, cost) are in standard currency units (not micros).

---

Decision-Making Rules:

| CTR (%) | CPA (Currency) | CPC (Currency) | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| High | Low | Low/Medium | **Prioritize** | Strong engagement and cost-effective conversions. |
| High | Medium | Medium | **Continue** | Performing well; maintain performance. |
| Medium | High | High | **Optimize** | Needs improvement; review targeting or creatives. |
| Low | High | High | **Pause/Exclude** | Poor engagement and inefficient spend. |
| No data | — | — | **Insufficient data** | Not enough performance to decide. |

---

Instructions:
- Use the provided metrics (`CPA`, `CTR`, and `CPC`) directly — do **not** recalculate them.
- Analyze performance for each gender (MALE, FEMALE, UNDETERMINED).
- For each gender, classify into:
  **Prioritize**, **Continue**, **Optimize**, **Pause**, or **Insufficient data**.
- Add `"is_optimized": true` for **Prioritize**, **Continue**, or **Optimize**.
- Add `"is_optimized": false` for **Pause**, **Exclude**, or **Insufficient data**.
- Include metric values (`CPA`, `CTR`, `CPC`) for each `optimized_genders` entry.
- Provide concise `"reason"` and `"rationale_summary"`.
- Output must be **strictly valid JSON** — no markdown or text outside JSON.
