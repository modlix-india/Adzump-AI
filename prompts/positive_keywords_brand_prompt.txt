# NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

## 1. BRAND-FOCUSED SELECTION (Partial Match Allowed)

<brand_matching_rules>
**If {brand_name} is a SINGLE WORD** (e.g., "Nike"):
- Keyword MUST contain the exact brand name

**If {brand_name} is MULTI-WORD** (e.g., "Valmark Cityville"):
- Keyword MUST contain AT LEAST ONE significant word from the brand name
- Significant words = nouns, proper nouns (exclude: "the", "and", "a", "an", "of")

**Examples for {brand_name} = "Valmark Cityville":**
<accept> "valmark apartments" (has "valmark")</accept>
<accept> "cityville homes" (has "cityville")</accept>
<accept> "valmark cityville villas" (has both)</accept>
<accept> "buy valmark property" (has "valmark")</accept>

<reject>✗ "luxury apartments bangalore" (no brand component)</reject>
<reject>✗ "3 bhk near me" (no brand component)</reject>

**Selection Rule:**
- Extract significant words from {brand_name} (split by spaces, remove common words)
- For each keyword, check if it contains ANY of these significant brand words
- If yes → eligible for selection
- If no → automatically reject
</brand_matching_rules>

<critical>
No exceptions - every keyword must have at least one significant brand word. This is a brand-protection campaign.
Select from provided data only - do not invent keywords.
</critical>

---

## 2. EXACT KEYWORD MATCHING

<matching_rules>
- Use EXACT keyword text from provided data
- Do not modify or alter keyword phrasing
- Preserve original capitalization and formatting
</matching_rules>

---

# MANDATORY FIRST KEYWORD

<position_one>
**Position 1 MUST BE:**
Select the brand name keyword (containing all brand components) as the first keyword with EXACT match.
This is mandatory for brand protection.

Example: If brand = "Valmark Cityville", first keyword should be "valmark cityville" with EXACT match.
</position_one>

---

# SELECTION STRATEGY

<priority_order>
After mandatory first keyword, prioritize in this order:

**1. High-Volume Simple Brand Terms** (volume ≥ 10, 2-4 words)

**2. Brand + Service Area Combinations**
- ONLY select keywords with locations from {service_areas}
- EXCLUDE keywords with locations NOT in {service_areas}

**3. Brand + Intent Keywords**
- Reviews, contact, price, booking, appointment, etc.

**4. Brand Misspellings**
- Common typos of brand name components

**5. Zero-Volume Brand Protection**
- Simple 2-4 word brand keywords
</priority_order>

# FILTERING RULES

<reject_these>

## RULE 1: Keywords Longer Than 5 Words
Reject any keyword with more than 5 words.

## RULE 2: Ultra-Specific Technical Details
<reject>
- Percentages, measurements, specifications
- Technical jargon, model numbers
- Industry-specific codes or certifications
</reject>

## RULE 3: Wrong Industry Terms
<reject>
Generic business terms that don't match {business_type}
Examples: "emergency services", "professional services", "quality assurance" (unless relevant to industry)
</reject>

## RULE 4: Wrong Geographic Locations
<location_validation>
- Analyze {service_areas} carefully
- ONLY include keywords with locations explicitly listed in {service_areas}
- REJECT keywords with locations NOT in {service_areas}
</location_validation>

<note>
**Feature/Amenity Keywords in Brand Campaigns:**

For brand campaigns, if a keyword contains brand components (per Rule #1), it is valid even if it mentions specific features or amenities.

Why? "Valmark pool villas" is someone searching for VALMARK's villas with pools, not generic pool villas. The brand presence makes it brand-focused.

The 5-word limit (Rule 1) already prevents overly specific feature combinations.

Only reject if:
- NO brand component present (handled by Brand Rule #1)
- Too long (>5 words)
</note>

</reject_these>

# MATCH TYPE ASSIGNMENT

<match_type_distribution>
Brand campaigns require specific distribution:
</match_type_distribution>

## EXACT (Position 1 ONLY - ~3%)
<exact_rules>
- **Position 1:** Full brand name keyword (mandatory for brand protection)
- Example: "valmark cityville" with EXACT match
</exact_rules>

## BROAD (Positions 2-4 = 10-15%)
<broad_guidelines>
- High-volume brand + location
- Brand + main product
- Simple 2-3 word brand combinations
- Examples: "valmark bangalore", "cityville villas", "valmark homes"
</broad_guidelines>

## PHRASE (Positions 5-24 = 60-70%)
<phrase_guidelines>
- Brand + service area combinations
- Brand + intent terms (reviews, contact, price, booking)
- Brand misspellings
- Zero-volume brand protection terms
- Examples: "valmark cityville reviews", "cityville near me", "valmark apartments whitefield"
</phrase_guidelines>

## EXACT (Positions 25-30 = 20-25%)
<exact_specific_guidelines>
- Very specific brand searches (still under 5 words)
- Critical brand variations you must own
- High-intent brand combinations
- Examples: "buy valmark villa", "valmark price", "valmark contact"
</exact_specific_guidelines>

5. Appropriate match type per position guidelines?
