---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

**1. BRAND-ONLY SELECTION**
- Every selected keyword MUST contain "{brand_name}"
- No exceptions - this is a brand-only campaign
- Select from provided data only - do not invent keywords

**2. EXACT KEYWORD MATCHING**
- Use EXACT keyword text from provided data
- Do not modify or alter keyword phrasing
- Preserve original capitalization and formatting

**3. MATCH TYPE DISTRIBUTION**
Brand campaigns require specific distribution:
- 1 keyword EXACT (position 1 - brand name)
- 3-4 keywords BROAD (10-15%)
- 19-20 keywords PHRASE (60-70%)
- 6-7 keywords EXACT (20-25%)

---

## MANDATORY FIRST KEYWORD

**Position 1 MUST BE:**
Select "{brand_name}" as the first keyword with EXACT match.
This is mandatory for brand protection.

---

## SELECTION STRATEGY

**Priority Order (After mandatory first keyword):**

1. **High-Volume Simple Brand Terms** (volume ≥ 10, 2-4 words)

2. **Brand + Service Area Combinations**
   - ONLY select keywords with locations from {service_areas}
   - EXCLUDE keywords with locations NOT in {service_areas}

3. **Brand + Intent Keywords**
   - Reviews, contact, price, booking, appointment, etc.

4. **Brand Misspellings**
   - Common typos of {brand_name}

5. **Zero-Volume Brand Protection**
   - Simple 2-4 word brand keywords

---

## FILTERING RULES - REJECT THESE

**❌ AUTOMATICALLY REJECT:**

**1. Keywords Longer Than 5 Words:**
Reject any keyword with more than 5 words.

**2. Individual Feature/Amenity Keywords:**
Reject keywords with specific features or amenities from {unique_features}.

**Universal rejection test:**
Ask: "Would someone search this to FIND THE BUSINESS, or to find this specific FEATURE?"
- To find the business → Keep (e.g., "brand [main product]")
- To find the feature → Reject (e.g., "brand [specific amenity]")

**Pattern-based rejection:**
- ❌ Facilities/amenities (pools, gyms, parking, seating, deck, lounge)
- ❌ Materials/ingredients (wood, clay, organic, steel, marble, tiles)
- ❌ Equipment/devices (ovens, machines, equipment, tools, systems)
- ❌ Technical features (automation, pathways, storage, API, cloud)
- ❌ Add-ons/extras (any secondary features mentioned in {unique_features})

**3. Ultra-Specific Technical Details:**
- Reject keywords with: percentages, measurements, specifications
- Reject technical jargon, model numbers

**4. Wrong Industry Terms:**
- Reject generic business terms that don't match {business_type}
- Examples: "emergency services", "professional services", "quality assurance"

**5. Wrong Geographic Locations:**
- Analyze {service_areas} carefully
- ONLY include keywords with locations explicitly listed in {service_areas}
- REJECT keywords with locations NOT in {service_areas}

## MATCH TYPE ASSIGNMENT

**EXACT (Position 1 ONLY):**
- Position 1: "{brand_name}" (mandatory for brand protection)

**BROAD (Positions 2-4 = 10-15%):**
- High-volume brand + location
- Brand + main product
- Simple 2-3 word brand combinations

**PHRASE (Positions 5-24 = 60-70%):**
- Brand + service area combinations
- Brand + intent terms
- Misspellings
- Zero-volume brand protection

**EXACT (Positions 25-30 = 20-25%):**
- Very specific brand searches (still under 5 words)
- Critical brand variations you must own

---
