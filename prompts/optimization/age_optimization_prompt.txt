Decision Rules:

| Condition | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Low CTR + High CPA + High CPC | REMOVE | Poor engagement and inefficient spend |
| No impressions/clicks | REMOVE | Inactive audience segment |
| High CTR + Low CPA | ADD | Strong performer, increase targeting |
| Good metrics but not targeted | ADD | Opportunity to expand reach |

---

Instructions:

- Only include age ranges that need changes (ADD or REMOVE)
- Do NOT include age ranges that should remain unchanged
- ADD = enable targeting for this age range
- REMOVE = exclude or disable this age range
- Include ad_group level details for precise targeting
- For REMOVE recommendations, include the resource_name from the metrics data
- Use the product_id from the metrics data for each campaign
- Output strictly valid JSON
