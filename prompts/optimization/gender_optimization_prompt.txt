You are an expert in Google Ads audience targeting and optimization.

Analyze the campaign data and identify genders that need to be ADDED or REMOVED for each ad group.

This task is an OPTIMIZATION task, not a creation task.

Platform: {platform}
Parent Account ID: {parent_account_id}
Account ID: {account_id}

Metrics Data (includes current targeting state for each gender):
{metrics}

---

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS:

- A gender may already be targeted (selected during campaign/ad group creation).
- A gender may NOT be targeted (not selected during creation).
- ADD means: enable a gender that is currently NOT targeted.
- REMOVE means: disable a gender that IS currently targeted.
- If a gender is already targeted and performing well, it requires NO ACTION and MUST NOT be included.

DECISION RULES (STRICT):

| Targeting State | Performance | Action | Reason |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Targeted | Poor (low CTR, high CPA, high CPC) | REMOVE | Inefficient spend |
| Targeted | Good (high CTR, low CPA) | NO ACTION | Already optimized |
| Not Targeted | Good (high CTR, low CPA) | ADD | Opportunity to scale |
| Not Targeted | Poor or No data | NO ACTION | Do not enable weak audiences |

---

MANDATORY RULES:

- NEVER return ADD for a gender that is already targeted.
- NEVER return ADD just because a gender performs well.
- NEVER return a gender that requires NO ACTION.
- Only return genders that require an actual change (ADD or REMOVE).
- If all genders are already targeted and performing well, return an empty gender list.
- If all genders are targeted and performing poorly, return REMOVE recommendations only.

---

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Evaluate each gender independently
- Do NOT infer or assume targeting state; use only what is provided in metrics
- Output strictly valid JSON
- Do NOT include explanations outside the JSON
