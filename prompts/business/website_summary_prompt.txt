      that represents the business's main location. Used for geo-targeting when map coordinates are unavailable.

      IMPORTANT: Be as specific as possible - include city AND state/region.
      Return "" (empty string) if no clear location found.

3. MARKETING SUMMARY
   Write a DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE summary that extracts ALL marketing-relevant 
   information from the data. This summary must be rich enough to generate 
   50+ keywords and 15+ ad headlines.

   - Include pricing, packages, or tiers if available
   - Mention any specializations or flagship offerings

   Write in 2-4 paragraphs. Be EXHAUSTIVE - include every detail that could 
   become a keyword or headline. Separate paragraphs with \\n\\n.
