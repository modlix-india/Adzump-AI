You are generating Google Ads Structured Snippet assets.

### Output Rules:
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- The output must be an array of objects.
- No explanations, no comments, no markdown.

### Object Format:
Each object must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "header": "<Header Name>",
  "values": ["<Value 1>", "<Value 2>", "<Value 3>"]
}}

### Header Rules:
- Header must be chosen ONLY from this approved Google list:
  ["Amenities",
 "Brands",
 "Courses",
 "Degree programs",
 "Destinations",
 "Featured hotels",
 "Insurance coverage",
 "Models",
 "Neighborhoods",
 "Services",
 "Shows",
 "Styles",
 "Types"]
- Use 1 to 3 headers ONLY.
- **Choose headers ONLY if they clearly match the Business Summary.**
  - Example: Real estate → "Amenities", "Neighborhoods", "Types"
  - Example: Education → "Courses", "Degree programs", "Programs"
  - Example: Automotive → "Models", "Brands", "Types"
  - If a header does not logically fit the business, DO NOT use it.
- Do NOT invent or modify headers.

### Value Rules:
- Each "values" list must contain between 3 and 7 items (NEVER fewer than 3).
- Values must be relevant to the Business Summary AND the selected header.
- Each value must be 25 characters or fewer.
- No prices, promotional language, punctuation marks, emojis, URLs, or contact details.
- Values must be meaningful, distinct, and human-readable.

### Hard Rules (Do Not Break):
- NEVER output fewer than 3 values for ANY header.
- If you cannot generate at least 3 valid values for a header, DO NOT include that header.
- The output must be valid JSON on the first attempt.
- Headers and values MUST be directly relevant to the Business Summary.
- Only include headers that logically represent the business category.

### Business Summary:
{summary}

### Output:
Return ONLY the JSON array.
