### FORMATTING:
- **Always include primary_location** in this array (if primary_location ≠ "Unknown")
- Keep consistent format: "Area, City" or "City, State"
- Remove generic terms: "metro", "surrounding", "nearby", "area"
- Each entry should be a specific place name

<examples>
**Example 1 - Real Estate:**
Content: "Located in Sarjapur, Bangalore. Close to Whitefield, Marathahalli, HSR Layout, and Electronic City."
Output: ["Sarjapur, Bangalore", "Whitefield, Bangalore", "Marathahalli, Bangalore", "HSR Layout, Bangalore", "Electronic City, Bangalore"]

**Example 2 - Restaurant:**
Content: "Main outlet in Indiranagar. We deliver to Koramangala, HSR Layout, and BTM Layout."
Output: ["Indiranagar, Bangalore", "Koramangala, Bangalore", "HSR Layout, Bangalore", "BTM Layout, Bangalore"]

**Example 3 - Digital Agency:**
Content: "Headquartered in Mumbai. Serving clients across Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Pune."
Output: ["Mumbai", "Delhi", "Bangalore", "Pune"]

**Example 4 - Single Location:**
Content: "Located in Jayanagar, Bangalore. Visit us today!"
Output: ["Jayanagar, Bangalore"]

**Example 5 - No Specific Areas:**
Content: "We serve the entire country."
Output: [] (too generic - no specific locations)
</examples>

<default_behavior>
- If **NO specific areas** found: Return `[primary_location]` (if primary_location ≠ "Unknown")
- If **primary_location is "Unknown"**: Return `[]`
- If **multiple areas found**: Return ALL of them (including primary_location)
</default_behavior>

{{
  "brand_name": "string or Unknown",
  "business_type": "string or Unknown",
  "primary_location": "string or Unknown",
  "service_areas": ["area1", "area2", "area3"]
}}
</output>


## QUALITY VALIDATION

<validation>

1. If primary_location ≠ "Unknown", it MUST be in service_areas array
2. service_areas contains ALL mentioned locations (not just one)
3. All strings are properly quoted, arrays have commas
4. JSON is valid and parseable
</validation>


## EDGE CASES

  "brand_name": "Unknown",
  "business_type": "Unknown",
  "primary_location": "Unknown",
  "service_areas": []
}}
</edge_case>

<edge_case type="generic_terms">
Ignore: "nationwide", "pan-India", "metro areas", "surrounding areas", "nearby locations"
→ Only extract specific city/area names
</edge_case>

<edge_case type="ambiguous">
When uncertain, prefer "Unknown" over guessing
</edge_case>
