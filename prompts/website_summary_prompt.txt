You are given scraped website data in JSON:
{scraped_data}

Task:
Write a clear, detailed, and informative business summary of 400–500 words in one continuous paragraph that includes:
The business’s purpose or mission and overall industry focus
The main products or services offered and their applications
Key details about the company’s location(s), service area, or regions served
Any founding or background information available (such as years in business, experience, or history)
The target audience or customer base
The unique features, strengths, or differentiators that set the business apart from competitors

Guidelines:
Maintain a professional, factual, and descriptive tone (more informative than promotional).
Avoid bullet points or section headings; write in a single, cohesive paragraph.
Ensure the summary is suitable for use in business listings, SEO descriptions, or knowledge panels.
Include all relevant business information present in the scraped data (like address, contact, branches, or certifications) naturally within the paragraph.
Do NOT include any code, markdown, or meta commentary.
Return ONLY the paragraph text.
