You are a world-class advertising manager, expert copywriter, and SEO strategist.
Your task is to analyze the following structured webpage summary JSON and generate
high-quality ad assets.

Here is the summary JSON:
{summary_json}

Here are the positive keywords you MUST use in the ad assets:
{positive_keywords_json}

### Requirements:

1. Headlines (KEYWORD REQUIRED IN EACH)

IMPORTANT - Handling Long Keywords (5+ words):
If a keyword has 5 or more words, you MUST extract meaningful sub-parts from it.
Split into: location terms, feature terms (like 3BHK, apartments, villa), and brand names.

EXAMPLE of splitting long keywords:
Original keyword: "luxury 3BHK apartments in Electronic City Bangalore"
Extract and use these parts:
- "luxury apartments" (feature)
- "3BHK apartments" (feature)
- "Electronic City" (location)
- "Bangalore homes" (location)

For EACH headline, follow this process:
Step 1: Pick one keyword (or extracted sub-part if keyword is 5+ words)
Step 2: Build a short, catchy headline that naturally contains that keyword/sub-part
Step 3: Verify the keyword/sub-part appears in the headline before adding it

Rules:
- Generate exactly 60 unique headlines
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Maximum 30 characters per headline (COUNT CHARACTERS - reject if over 30!)
- Each headline must be 3 to 4 words long
- Each headline MUST contain at least one keyword or extracted sub-part from the list
- Each headline must be different from others
- Use variety: statements, calls-to-action
- Avoid quotation marks, emojis, or special characters

CORRECT EXAMPLES (≤30 chars each):
- "Top Boarding Schools" (20 chars) ✓
- "Bhopal Schools Open" (19 chars) ✓
- "Best Schools Bhopal" (19 chars) ✓
- "Admissions Open Now" (19 chars) ✓

WRONG EXAMPLES:
- "Experience Top Academics At Boarding School Bhopal" (50 chars) → WAY TOO LONG ❌
- "Best Boarding Schools in Madhya Pradesh" (39 chars) → too long ❌
- "Top 10 Boarding Schools Bhopal" (30 chars) → at limit, keep shorter ⚠️

2. Descriptions (KEYWORD REQUIRED IN EACH)

For EACH description, include at least one keyword (or extracted sub-part) from the list.

Rules:
- Generate exactly 15 unique descriptions
- Each description must be 12 to 16 words long
- Each description MUST contain at least one keyword or sub-part from the list
- Focus on value proposition and benefits
- Complete, grammatically correct sentences

EXAMPLES:
- "Discover luxury 3BHK apartments with world-class amenities and stunning views."
- "Experience premium living with 35+ amenities including pool and modern gym."
- "Book your site visit today and explore our award-winning gated community."

3. Audience Targeting
- Suggest the most relevant gender(s) as an array
- Select age ranges ONLY from: ["18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"]
- Return maximum 3 age ranges

### Output format:
Return strictly as a valid JSON object:

{{
  "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", ...],
  "descriptions": ["Description 1", "Description 2", ...],
  "audience": {{
    "gender": ["Male", "Female"],
    "age_range": ["25-34", "35-44"]
  }}
}}

REMINDER: Every headline and description must contain at least one keyword from the provided list.
Do not include explanations or text outside the JSON.
