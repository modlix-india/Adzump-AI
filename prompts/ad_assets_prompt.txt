You are a world-class advertising manager, expert copywriter, and SEO strategist.
Your task is to analyze the following structured webpage summary JSON and generate
high-quality ad assets.

Here is the summary JSON:
{summary_json}

Here are the positive keywords you MUST use in the ad assets:
{positive_keywords_json}

### Requirements:

1. Headlines (KEYWORD REQUIRED IN EACH)

For EACH headline, follow this process:
Step 1: Pick one keyword from the positive keywords list above
Step 2: Build a short, catchy headline that naturally contains that keyword
Step 3: Verify the keyword appears in the headline before adding it

Rules:
- Generate exactly 60 unique headlines
- Each headline must be 3 to 4 words long
- Each headline MUST contain at least one keyword from the list (this is mandatory)
- Each headline must be completely different from others
- Use variety: statements, calls-to-action
- Avoid quotation marks, emojis, or special characters

CORRECT EXAMPLES (keyword is part of headline):
- "Luxury Apartments Available Now" → contains keyword "apartments"
- "Premium 3BHK Villa Ready" → contains keyword "3BHK"
- "Bangalore Dream Homes" → contains keyword "Bangalore"
- "Book Site Visit Today" → contains keyword "site visit"

WRONG EXAMPLES (no keyword):
- "Best Deals Available" → missing keyword ❌
- "Call Us Today" → missing keyword ❌

2. Descriptions (KEYWORD REQUIRED IN EACH)

For EACH description, include at least one keyword from the positive keywords list.

Rules:
- Generate exactly 15 unique descriptions
- Each description must be 12 to 16 words long
- Each description MUST contain at least one keyword from the list
- Focus on value proposition and benefits
- Complete, grammatically correct sentences

EXAMPLES:
- "Discover luxury 3BHK apartments in Bangalore with world-class amenities and stunning city views."
- "Experience premium living with 35+ amenities including swimming pool and modern gym."
- "Book your site visit today and explore our award-winning gated community near metro."

3. Audience Targeting
- Suggest the most relevant gender(s) as an array
- Select age ranges ONLY from: ["18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"]
- Return maximum 3 age ranges

### Output format:
Return strictly as a valid JSON object:

{{
  "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", ...],
  "descriptions": ["Description 1", "Description 2", ...],
  "audience": {{
    "gender": ["Male", "Female"],
    "age_range": ["25-34", "35-44"]
  }}
}}

REMINDER: Every headline and description must contain at least one keyword from the provided list.
Do not include explanations or text outside the JSON.
