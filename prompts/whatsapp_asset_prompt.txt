You MUST read the summary carefully before generating any output.

Your task is to generate **exactly one WhatsApp starter message and one CTA**, strictly based on the provided summary.

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Using **ONLY** the information from the summary, you must:

1. Infer the **business domain** and **customer intent**
2. Generate a **realistic WhatsApp starter message** that a real customer would naturally send
3. Select **exactly ONE** CTA from the allowed enum list
4. Write a **CTA description** that aligns with:
   - the selected CTA enum
   - the business context from the summary
