# NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

## 1. NO BRAND NAMES

<brand_exclusion>
- EXCLUDE any keywords containing "{brand_name}"
- This is a generic-only campaign
- Focus on service/product intent, not brand awareness
</brand_exclusion>

---

## 2. EXACT KEYWORD MATCHING

<matching_rules>
- Use EXACT keyword text from provided data
- Do not modify or alter keyword phrasing
- Preserve original capitalization and formatting
</matching_rules>

---

## 3. MATCH TYPE STRATEGY

<match_type_philosophy>
Assign match types based on keyword characteristics and business context, NOT fixed positions.

Analyze each keyword and assign the appropriate match type based on its:
- Relevance to {business_type}
- Search intent (discovery vs conversion)
- Specificity level
- Risk level (cross-business status)
- Potential for query expansion
</match_type_philosophy>

<target_distribution>
**Aim for approximately:**
- 10% BROAD match (discovery keywords)
- 70% PHRASE match (core keywords)
- 20% EXACT match (high-precision keywords)

But prioritize correct match type assignment over hitting exact percentages.
Quality of assignment matters more than rigid distribution.
</target_distribution>

# MANDATORY PRE-FILTER

<pre_filter>
Before selecting ANY keyword, verify:

**1. BASIC RELEVANCE**
- No brand name "{brand_name}"?
- From provided data?
- Generally relevant to {business_type} or related services?

**2. LOCATION VALIDATION (Dynamic Check)**

<location_rules>
Extract location from keyword and check against {service_areas}:

**Process:**
1. Does keyword mention a specific location?
2. If YES: Is that location IN {service_areas}?
3. If location is in {service_areas} → Include
4. If location NOT in {service_areas} → Exclude
5. If city-level location (e.g., "bangalore") but no specific area → Include if {service_areas} are in that city
6. If no location mentioned → Include (location-agnostic keyword)

**Dynamic Examples:**

If {service_areas} = ["sarjapur", "whitefield", "electronic city"]:
<accept>"villas sarjapur" (location matches)</accept>
<accept>"villas bangalore" (city-level, service areas are in bangalore)</accept>
<reject>"villas north bangalore" (location NOT in service areas)</reject>

If {service_areas} = ["north bangalore", "yelahanka", "hebbal"]:
<accept>"villas north bangalore" (location matches)</accept>
<reject>"villas sarjapur" (location NOT in service areas)</reject>

<critical>
Location filtering must be DYNAMIC - always check against {service_areas} variable.
Never create absolute rules - same keyword can be accepted or rejected based on actual service areas.
</critical>
</location_rules>

**3. VOLUME QUALITY**
For zero-volume keywords (volume = 0):
- If word count > 4 → SKIP (too complex)
- If contains technical specs (percentages, measurements) → SKIP
- Only include if CORE to {business_type}

<note>
Keywords from related industries CAN be included but will require careful match type control.
See Match Type Assignment section for cross-business handling rules.
</note>
</pre_filter>

# SELECTION STRATEGY

<priority_order>
After pre-filter, prioritize in this order:

1. **High-Volume Terms in Service Areas** (volume > 100 + location match)
2. **Service + Exact Location** combinations from {service_areas}
3. **Action Intent** terms (hire, find, book, buy) + service area
4. **Problem-Solution** keywords with location
5. **Commercial Research** terms (best, reviews, compare) + location
6. **Remaining relevant terms** to reach {target_count}
</priority_order>

---

# MATCH TYPE ASSIGNMENT

<assignment_criteria>
Analyze each keyword and assign match type based on these criteria:

## BROAD MATCH [~10%]

<when_to_use_broad>
**Assign BROAD match when ALL of these are true:**

1. **High Relevance:** Core service/product keyword directly related to {business_type}
2. **Discovery Intent:** Broad search term for reaching new audiences
3. **Low Risk:** Won't attract completely irrelevant searches
4. **NOT Cross-Business:** Keyword is NOT from a different industry
5. **Expansion Potential:** Query expansion will likely stay relevant

**Keyword Characteristics:**
- Short, general terms (2-3 words)
- High search volume potential
- Clear business category match
- Room for beneficial query expansion

**Examples:**
- Real Estate: "villas bangalore", "buy property"
- Restaurant: "italian restaurant", "food delivery"
- Fitness: "gym bangalore", "personal training"

<never_broad>
**NEVER Assign BROAD to:**
- Cross-business keywords (different industry)
- Highly specific technical terms
- Ambiguous multi-intent keywords
- Low-volume, niche-specific terms
</never_broad>

**Why this restriction?** 
Broad match expands reach significantly through Google's query matching. 
If the base keyword isn't perfectly aligned with your core business, 
expansion will generate irrelevant clicks that waste budget on users with zero purchase intent.
</when_to_use_broad>

---

## PHRASE MATCH [~70%]

<when_to_use_phrase>
**Assign PHRASE match when:**

1. **Moderate Specificity:** Contains location, qualifier, or specific feature
2. **Balanced Control Needed:** Want reach but with context preservation
3. **Cross-Business Keywords:** If including risky cross-industry terms
4. **Action Intent:** Contains verbs like buy, find, book, hire
5. **Qualified Searches:** Contains modifiers like best, affordable, near me

**Keyword Characteristics:**
- 3-5 words with specific context
- Location + service combinations
- Qualified searches with modifiers
- Most campaign keywords fall here
- Default choice when uncertain

**Examples:**
- "villas in sarjapur", "buy villa whitefield"
- "italian restaurant koramangala", "pizza delivery near me"
- "gym in whitefield", "personal training near me"

**This is your default match type** for most keywords. When in doubt, use phrase match.
</when_to_use_phrase>

---

## EXACT MATCH [~20%]

<when_to_use_exact>
**Assign EXACT match when:**

1. **High Precision Needed:** Very specific, conversion-focused searches
2. **Exact Intent Match:** Keyword perfectly describes what you offer
3. **High-Risk Cross-Business:** Risky keywords that need maximum control
4. **High-Value Terms:** Critical conversion keywords worth exact targeting
5. **Complete Specificity:** 4-5+ words with full search intent

**Keyword Characteristics:**
- Very specific (4-5+ words)
- Complete search intent captured
- High conversion potential
- Needs maximum control
- No query expansion desired

**Examples:**
- "3 bhk apartments in sarjapur", "luxury villas for sale whitefield"
- "italian restaurant with outdoor seating bangalore"
- "24 hour gym in whitefield", "ladies only gym koramangala"

**Use for precision targeting** where you want zero query expansion.
</when_to_use_exact>

</assignment_criteria>

<cross_business_handling>
## CROSS-BUSINESS KEYWORD HANDLING

<cross_business_definition>
**What is "Cross-Business"?**

A keyword is "cross-business" when it could attract users looking for a DIFFERENT type of business than {business_type}.

**Key test:** Would someone searching this keyword be surprised to see an ad for {business_type}?
- If YES → Cross-business
- If NO → Core business keyword

**Examples:**
- Real estate business: "gym near me" is cross-business (user wants gym, not property)
- Restaurant business: "villas for sale" is cross-business (user wants property, not food)
- Fitness business: "food delivery" is cross-business (user wants food, not fitness)
</cross_business_definition>

<critical>
**CRITICAL RULE FOR CROSS-BUSINESS KEYWORDS:**

Cross-business keywords CAN be included in the campaign, but:
- Must be assigned PHRASE or EXACT match ONLY
- NEVER assign BROAD match
- Mark `"is_cross_business": true` in output
- Include rationale explaining why it's cross-business

**Why allow them?** They can generate valuable traffic when controlled with phrase/exact match.

Example: Real estate business including "gym near me"
- BROAD match: Expands to all gym-related searches, shows ads to people only wanting gym memberships (wastes budget on completely irrelevant clicks)
- PHRASE match: Only shows for queries containing "gym near me" in context, can match "properties with gym near me" or "villas with gym near me" (targeted, relevant traffic)

**Why the restriction?** Cross-business keywords carry inherent ambiguity about user intent. Phrase/exact match preserves the surrounding context that indicates whether the search is relevant to your business, while broad match strips away that context through aggressive query expansion.
</critical>
</cross_business_handling>

<decision_process>
## MATCH TYPE DECISION PROCESS

**For Each Keyword, Ask These Questions:**

**1. Is it cross-business?**
- Would a searcher expect a different business type?
- If YES → PHRASE or EXACT only (skip broad consideration)
- If NO → Continue to next question

**2. How specific is it?**
- 2-3 words, general service → Consider BROAD (if core business)
- 3-4 words, moderate detail → PHRASE
- 4+ words, very specific → EXACT

**3. What's the search intent?**
- Discovery/awareness stage → BROAD or PHRASE
- Research/consideration stage → PHRASE
- Ready to convert → EXACT

**4. What's the risk level?**
- Low risk (perfectly matches {business_type}) → Can use BROAD
- Medium risk (somewhat related) → PHRASE
- High risk (cross-business, ambiguous) → PHRASE or EXACT

**5. How much query expansion is beneficial?**
- Lots of beneficial expansion → BROAD
- Some expansion helpful → PHRASE
- No expansion wanted → EXACT
</decision_process>

<strategic_guidelines>
## STRATEGIC MATCH TYPE GUIDELINES

**BROAD = Discovery Engine**
- Use sparingly (~10% of keywords)
- Only for core business terms
- Maximizes reach for highly relevant categories
- Risk: Can attract irrelevant traffic if not careful

**PHRASE = Workhorse**
- Your default choice (~70% of keywords)
- Balances reach and control
- Most keywords should land here
- Safe choice when uncertain

**EXACT = Sniper Rifle**
- Use for precision (~20% of keywords)
- High-intent, specific searches
- Maximum control, minimum waste
- Worth it for high-value conversion terms

<critical>
**Key Principles:**

- Think strategically - match type should serve the keyword's purpose
- BROAD = Core business only - never for cross-business or risky terms
- PHRASE = Default workhorse - when in doubt, use phrase
- EXACT = Precision targeting - for specific, high-value searches
- Aim for ~10/70/20 distribution but prioritize quality over quotas
</critical>
</strategic_guidelines>

# CRITICAL REMINDERS

<final_reminders>
1. **Brand exclusion:** EXCLUDE all keywords containing "{brand_name}"

2. **Cross-business handling:**
   - Cross-business keywords CAN be included
   - Must use PHRASE or EXACT match ONLY (never BROAD)
   - Mark `"is_cross_business": true`

3. **Location filtering:**
   - DYNAMIC check against {service_areas} variable
   - Never use hard-coded location rules
   - Same keyword accepted/rejected based on actual service areas

4. **Match type assignment:**
   - Think strategically, not positionally
   - Analyze keyword characteristics, intent, risk, specificity
   - BROAD = core business, low risk, discovery
   - PHRASE = default workhorse, balanced control
   - EXACT = high precision, specific intent
   - Aim for ~10/70/20 but prioritize quality over quotas

5. **Data integrity:**
   - All keywords from provided data only
   - No modifications to keyword text
   - Exact {target_count} keywords required

6. **Risk management:**
   - BROAD match = core business terms only
   - Cross-business = phrase/exact for controlled reach
   - Location validation prevents irrelevant geographic targeting
   - When uncertain about match type, default to PHRASE
</final_reminders>

<closing>
Generic campaigns maximize reach while controlling relevance through intelligent match type strategy. Each keyword should have the match type that best serves its purpose - discovery (broad), balanced control (phrase), or precision (exact). Cross-business keywords are opportunities when properly managed with phrase/exact match types.
