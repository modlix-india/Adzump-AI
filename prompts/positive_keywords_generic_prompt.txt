# NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

## 1. NO BRAND NAMES

<brand_exclusion>
- EXCLUDE any keywords containing "{brand_name}"
- This is a generic-only campaign
- Focus on service/product intent, not brand awareness
</brand_exclusion>

---

## 2. EXACT KEYWORD MATCHING

<matching_rules>
- Use EXACT keyword text from provided data
- Do not modify or alter keyword phrasing
- Preserve original capitalization and formatting
</matching_rules>

---

## 3. MATCH TYPE STRATEGY

<match_type_philosophy>
Assign match types based on keyword characteristics and business context, NOT fixed positions.

Analyze each keyword and assign the appropriate match type based on its:
- Relevance to {business_type}
- Search intent (discovery vs conversion)
- Specificity level
- Risk level (cross-business status)
- Potential for query expansion
</match_type_philosophy>

<target_distribution>
**Aim for approximately:**
- 80-90% PHRASE match (core keywords)
- 10-20% EXACT match (high-precision keywords)

But prioritize correct match type assignment over hitting exact percentages.
Quality of assignment matters more than rigid distribution.
</target_distribution>

# MANDATORY PRE-FILTER

<pre_filter>
Before selecting ANY keyword, verify:

**1. BASIC RELEVANCE**
- No brand name "{brand_name}"?
- From provided data?
- Generally relevant to {business_type} or related services?

**2. LOCATION VALIDATION (Dynamic Check)**

<location_rules>
Extract location from keyword and check against {service_areas}:

**Process:**
1. Does keyword mention a specific location?
2. If YES: Is that location IN {service_areas}?
3. If location is in {service_areas} → Include
4. If location NOT in {service_areas} → Exclude
5. If city-level location (e.g., "bangalore") but no specific area → Include if {service_areas} are in that city
6. If no location mentioned → Include (location-agnostic keyword)

**Dynamic Examples:**

If {service_areas} = ["sarjapur", "whitefield", "electronic city"]:
<accept>"villas sarjapur" (location matches)</accept>
<accept>"villas bangalore" (city-level, service areas are in bangalore)</accept>
<reject>"villas north bangalore" (location NOT in service areas)</reject>

If {service_areas} = ["north bangalore", "yelahanka", "hebbal"]:
<accept>"villas north bangalore" (location matches)</accept>
<reject>"villas sarjapur" (location NOT in service areas)</reject>

<critical>
Location filtering must be DYNAMIC - always check against {service_areas} variable.
Never create absolute rules - same keyword can be accepted or rejected based on actual service areas.
</critical>
</location_rules>

**3. VOLUME QUALITY**
For zero-volume keywords (volume = 0):
- If word count > 4 → SKIP (too complex)
- If contains technical specs (percentages, measurements) → SKIP
- Only include if CORE to {business_type}

<note>
Keywords from related industries CAN be included but will require careful match type control.
See Match Type Assignment section for cross-business handling rules.
</note>
</pre_filter>

# SELECTION STRATEGY

<priority_order>
After pre-filter, prioritize in this order:

1. **High-Volume Terms in Service Areas** (volume > 100 + location match)
2. **Service + Exact Location** combinations from {service_areas}
3. **Action Intent** terms (hire, find, book, buy) + service area
4. **Problem-Solution** keywords with location
5. **Commercial Research** terms (best, reviews, compare) + location
6. **Remaining relevant terms** to reach {target_count}
</priority_order>

---

# MATCH TYPE ASSIGNMENT

<assignment_criteria>
Analyze each keyword and assign match type based on these criteria:

## PHRASE MATCH [~80-90%]

<when_to_use_phrase>
**Assign PHRASE match when:**

1. **Moderate Specificity:** Contains location, qualifier, or specific feature
2. **Balanced Control Needed:** Want reach but with context preservation
3. **Cross-Business Keywords:** If including risky cross-industry terms
4. **Action Intent:** Contains verbs like buy, find, book, hire
5. **Qualified Searches:** Contains modifiers like best, affordable, near me
6. **Core Business Terms:** High-volume terms that would previously be Broad match

**Keyword Characteristics:**
- 3-5 words with specific context
- Location + service combinations
- Qualified searches with modifiers
- Most campaign keywords fall here
- Default choice when uncertain

**Examples:**
- "villas in sarjapur", "buy villa whitefield"
- "italian restaurant koramangala", "pizza delivery near me"
- "gym in whitefield", "personal training near me"

**This is your default match type** for most keywords. When in doubt, use phrase match.
</when_to_use_phrase>

---

## EXACT MATCH [~10-20%]

<when_to_use_exact>
**Assign EXACT match when:**

1. **High Precision Needed:** Very specific, conversion-focused searches
2. **Exact Intent Match:** Keyword perfectly describes what you offer
3. **High-Risk Cross-Business:** Risky keywords that need maximum control
4. **High-Value Terms:** Critical conversion keywords worth exact targeting
5. **Complete Specificity:** 4-5+ words with full search intent

**Keyword Characteristics:**
- Very specific (4-5+ words)
- Complete search intent captured
- High conversion potential
- Needs maximum control
- No query expansion desired

**Examples:**
- "3 bhk apartments in sarjapur", "luxury villas for sale whitefield"
- "italian restaurant with outdoor seating bangalore"
- "24 hour gym in whitefield", "ladies only gym koramangala"

**Use for precision targeting** where you want zero query expansion.
</when_to_use_exact>

</assignment_criteria>

<cross_business_handling>
## CROSS-BUSINESS KEYWORD HANDLING

<cross_business_definition>
**What is "Cross-Business"?**

A keyword is "cross-business" when it could attract users looking for a DIFFERENT type of business than {business_type}.

**Key test:** Would someone searching this keyword be surprised to see an ad for {business_type}?
- If YES → Cross-business
- If NO → Core business keyword

**Examples:**
- Real estate business: "gym near me" is cross-business (user wants gym, not property)
- Restaurant business: "villas for sale" is cross-business (user wants property, not food)
- Fitness business: "food delivery" is cross-business (user wants food, not fitness)
</cross_business_definition>

<critical>
**CRITICAL RULE FOR CROSS-BUSINESS KEYWORDS:**

Cross-business keywords CAN be included in the campaign, but:
- Must be assigned PHRASE or EXACT match ONLY
- NEVER assign BROAD match
- Mark `"is_cross_business": true` in output
- Include rationale explaining why it's cross-business

**Why allow them?** They can generate valuable traffic when controlled with phrase/exact match.

Example: Real estate business including "gym near me"
- BROAD match: Expands to all gym-related searches, shows ads to people only wanting gym memberships (wastes budget on completely irrelevant clicks)
- PHRASE match: Only shows for queries containing "gym near me" in context, can match "properties with gym near me" or "villas with gym near me" (targeted, relevant traffic)

**Why the restriction?** Cross-business keywords carry inherent ambiguity about user intent. Phrase/exact match preserves the surrounding context that indicates whether the search is relevant to your business, while broad match strips away that context through aggressive query expansion.
</critical>
</cross_business_handling>

<decision_process>
## MATCH TYPE DECISION PROCESS

**For Each Keyword, Ask These Questions:**

**1. Is it cross-business?**
- Would a searcher expect a different business type?
- If YES → PHRASE or EXACT only
- If NO → Continue to next question

**2. How specific is it?**
- 3-4 words, moderate detail → PHRASE
- 4+ words, very specific → EXACT

**3. What's the search intent?**
- Research/consideration stage → PHRASE
- Ready to convert → EXACT

**4. What's the risk level?**
- Medium risk (somewhat related) → PHRASE
- High risk (cross-business, ambiguous) → PHRASE or EXACT

**5. How much query expansion is beneficial?**
- Some expansion helpful → PHRASE
- No expansion wanted → EXACT
</decision_process>

<strategic_guidelines>
## STRATEGIC MATCH TYPE GUIDELINES
**PHRASE = Workhorse**
- Your default choice (~80-90% of keywords)
- Balances reach and control
- Most keywords should land here
- Safe choice when uncertain

**EXACT = Sniper Rifle**
- Use for precision (~10-20% of keywords)
- High-intent, specific searches
- Maximum control, minimum waste
- Worth it for high-value conversion terms

<critical>
**Key Principles:**

- Think strategically - match type should serve the keyword's purpose
- PHRASE = Default workhorse - when in doubt, use phrase
- EXACT = Precision targeting - for specific, high-value searches
- Aim for ~80-90% PHRASE and ~10-20% EXACT distribution
</critical>

# CRITICAL REMINDERS

<final_reminders>
1. **Brand exclusion:** EXCLUDE all keywords containing "{brand_name}"

2. **Cross-business handling:**
   - Cross-business keywords CAN be included
   - Must use PHRASE or EXACT match ONLY (never BROAD)
   - Mark `"is_cross_business": true`

3. **Location filtering:**
   - DYNAMIC check against {service_areas} variable
   - Never use hard-coded location rules
   - Same keyword accepted/rejected based on actual service areas

4. **Match type assignment:**
   - Think strategically, not positionally
   - Analyze keyword characteristics, intent, risk, specificity
   - PHRASE = default workhorse, balanced control
   - EXACT = high precision, specific intent
   - Aim for ~80-90% PHRASE and ~10-20% EXACT

5. **Data integrity:**
   - All keywords from provided data only
   - No modifications to keyword text
   - Exact {target_count} keywords required

6. **Risk management:**
   - Cross-business = phrase/exact for controlled reach
   - Location validation prevents irrelevant geographic targeting
   - When uncertain about match type, default to PHRASE
</final_reminders>

<closing>
Generic campaigns maximize reach while controlling relevance through intelligent match type strategy. Each keyword should have the match type that best serves its purpose - balanced control (phrase), or precision (exact). Cross-business keywords are opportunities when properly managed with phrase/exact match types.
