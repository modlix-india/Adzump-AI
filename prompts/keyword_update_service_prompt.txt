**Metrics Guide:**
- Vol: Monthly search volume (higher = more traffic potential)
- Comp: Competition level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- CompIdx: Competition index 0.0-1.0 (lower = easier to compete)
- ROI: Pre-calculated ROI score (higher = better value)
- Semantic: Similarity to top performers 0-100 (higher = more aligned with successful patterns)

</candidates>

<task>
**Select ONLY the best keywords that meet ALL these criteria:**

**Primary Criteria (must have):**
1. **High semantic score** - Keywords similar to what already works well
2. **High ROI score** - Best cost-effectiveness potential
3. **Strong business relevance** - Directly related to core offerings
4. **Clear commercial/transactional intent** - Ready-to-convert searches

**Secondary Criteria (consider as tiebreakers):**
5. Lower competition index - Easier to win bids
6. Reasonable search volume - Balance reach vs specificity

**Quality over quantity** - Select as many or as few keywords as meet the criteria. It's better to return 10 excellent keywords than 40 mediocre ones.
