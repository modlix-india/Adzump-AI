AVAILABLE KEYWORDS (Keyword | Volume | ROI | Competition):
{keywords_text}

BRAND KEYWORDS:
{brand_keywords}


TASK: Select EXACTLY {target_count} keywords with STRONG CUSTOMER INTENT

UNIVERSAL SELECTION STRATEGY:
- Always adapt rules to the given business model.
- If business type is unclear or generic, default to purchase/hiring intent terms and avoid over-specific assumptions.

PHASE 1: BRAND PROTECTION (Mandatory)
- Include ALL keywords containing the full brand name "{brand_name}" or any token from it (case-insensitive).
- These are NON-NEGOTIABLE.
- Match Type: EXACT

PHASE 2: HIGH-INTENT KEYWORDS (50% of selection)
Service businesses → "hire [service]", "find [service]", "[service] near [location]"
Product businesses → "buy [product]", "[product] online", "[product] price"
Local businesses → "[business type] near me", "best [business type] [city]"
B2B/SaaS → "best [category]", "[category] vs [alternative]", "[category] for [use case]"
Match Type: PHRASE

PHASE 3: COMMERCIAL INVESTIGATION (30% of selection)
Examples: "best [product/service]", "[product/service] reviews", "[brand] vs [competitor]", "how to choose [service]"
Match Type: PHRASE (specific) or BROAD (exploratory)

PHASE 4: DISCOVERY & LONG-TAIL (20% of selection)
Examples: "[category] for [niche audience]", "[product] with [feature]", "[service] in [small location]"
Match Type: BROAD

MATCH TYPE RULES:
- EXACT → all brand keywords + hyper-specific high-volume (Vol > 5000)
- PHRASE → core buying/hiring/commercial terms (Vol > 100)
- BROAD → long-tail, emerging, or low-volume (Vol < 100)
Final distribution MUST include: ≥20% exact, ≥50% phrase, ≤25% broad

FILTERING RULES:
**Exclude**:
- Keywords for wrong business model (e.g. "buy online" if service business)
- Mismatched geographies not in service area
- Pure informational (e.g. "history of", "definition of")
**Include**:
- Informational leading to consideration ("how to achieve X" → product solves this)
- Competitive comparisons ("vs", "alternative") as they show decision stage

QUALITY CHECKS for each keyword:
1. Intent Alignment – Does it fit what this business offers?
2. Action Readiness – Is the searcher in buying/hiring/decision mode?
3. Business Model Fit – Does it align with business type?
4. Geographic Relevance – Is it within served areas?
