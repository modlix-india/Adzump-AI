- Does this business offer free services or trials? Check: {scraped_data}
- Is this a budget/discount-focused business? Check: {scraped_data}
- Does this business operate in education/training? Check: {scraped_data}
- Is this a software/tech business? Check: {scraped_data}
- Is this a recruitment/HR business? Check: {scraped_data}

**Adjust exclusions based on actual business model.**

### CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES

**Your negative keywords MUST pass these checks:**

1. **NO POSITIVE KEYWORD CONFLICTS**
   - Do NOT create negatives that match any positive keywords
   - Do NOT create negatives with high token overlap (≥80%) with positives
   - Check against: {positive_text}

2. **SAFETY FILTER COMPLIANCE**
   - No inappropriate or sensitive content
   - No offensive or harmful terms
   - Keep professional and brand-safe

3. **LENGTH & FORMAT REQUIREMENTS**
   - 2-50 characters length
   - No special characters (! @ % , *)
   - Lowercase, search-friendly format

4. **NO DUPLICATES OR SEMANTIC OVERLAP**
   - Do not include multiple variations of the same concept
   - Choose the most representative version of each exclusion
   - Merge close variants into single keywords

### NEGATIVE KEYWORD STRATEGY

**1. CONTEXTUAL EXCLUSIONS (Adjust based on business analysis):**
- "free" (ONLY if business doesn't offer free services)
- "cheap", "discount", "coupon" (ONLY if not budget-focused business)
- "jobs", "career", "hiring", "employment" (ONLY if not HR/recruitment business)
- "tutorial", "how to", "diy" (ONLY if not educational business)
- "download", "software", "app" (ONLY if not tech business)

**2. BUSINESS-SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS:**
- Wrong industries or services not offered
- Competitor brand names (different markets only)
- Wrong customer segments (B2B/B2C mismatch)
- Geographic areas not served
- Price points not aligned with business model

**3. INTENT MISMATCHES:**
- Pure informational searches ("what is", "history of")
- Wrong purchase stage (research vs ready-to-buy)
- Wrong use cases not served
- Educational or DIY intent vs professional service

### QUALITY CHECKS

**Before including any negative keyword, ask:**
- Would this search EVER convert for this business?
- Does this clearly protect budget without blocking opportunities?
- Is there any scenario where this could be a qualified lead?
- Does this conflict with any positive keywords?
- Is this a duplicate or semantic overlap with another negative?

### RATIONALE FORMAT
**Use standardized format: "[CATEGORY] - [business-specific reason]"**

**Categories (choose one):**
- Intent filter
- Budget protection  
- Industry mismatch
- Geographic exclusion
- Audience filter

**Examples:**
- "Intent filter - educational searches not served"
- "Budget protection - premium service model"
- "Industry mismatch - different business vertical"
- "Geographic exclusion - local service area only"
- "Audience filter - B2B focus, excludes consumer"

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
**Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown, no commentary.**
