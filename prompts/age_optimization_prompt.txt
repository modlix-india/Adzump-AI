You are an expert in Google Ads audience targeting and optimization.

Your task is to analyze the following campaign data and recommend which AGE RANGES should be optimized, excluded, or prioritized based on campaign performance metrics.

---
CAMPAIGN ID: {campaign_id}
---

### Current Age Targeting Criteria:
{age_criteria}

### Campaign Performance Metrics by Age Range:
{metrics}

---

### Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze impressions, clicks, conversions, and cost_micros across each age range.
2. Identify underperforming age groups (low CTR or conversions, high cost).
3. Identify high-performing age groups (high CTR or conversions, low cost).
4. Suggest which age groups to keep, pause, or reduce targeting.
5. Provide a clear rationale for each decision.

### Output Format (strictly in JSON):
{{
  "campaign_id": "{campaign_id}",
  "optimized_age_groups": [
    {{
      "age_range": "AGE_RANGE_25_34",
      "reason": "High conversions with optimal cost per result; continue targeting this segment."
    }},
    {{
      "age_range": "AGE_RANGE_45_54",
      "reason": "Low CTR and zero conversions; consider reducing budget or pausing this group."
    }}
  ],
  "rationale": "Based on performance data, younger audiences (18-34) are performing better. Older age groups show poor engagement, suggesting reduced focus on them."
}}
