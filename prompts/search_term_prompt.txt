You are a Google Ads expert. Here is a search term with metrics:
{{SEARCH_TERM_DATA}}

Important context:
- costPerConversion = raw_cpc / 1_000_000 if raw_cpc is not None (converts micros to INR).
- Recommendation logic:
  1. If costPerConversion is None, recommendation is "not yet available" and reason is "No costPerConversion data available yet."
  2. If costPerConversion < 1000, recommendation is "positive".
  3. Otherwise, recommendation is "negative".

Return ONLY a JSON object with these top-level keys:
- recommendation: "positive" | "negative" | "not yet available"
- reason: a single human-readable sentence explaining why this recommendation makes sense.

Do not include any extra text or quotes outside valid JSON.
