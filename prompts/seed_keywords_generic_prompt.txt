## STEP 2: EXTRACT CORE OFFERINGS

From {unique_features}, identify the SPECIFIC things customers want:

**If Physical Products:**
- Extract: product names, product categories, brands (not the business's brand)
- Example: "laptops, gaming accessories, wireless headphones" → use each

**If Local Services:**
- Extract: specific service types, problem solutions
- Example: "leak repair, installation, emergency fixes" → use each

**If Healthcare:**
- Extract: treatments, procedures, specializations
- Example: "root canal, teeth whitening, dental implants" → use each

**If Real Estate:**
- Extract: property types, sizes, configurations
- Example: "3 BHK apartments, villas, plots" → use each

**If Food:**
- Extract: cuisines, dishes, meal types
- Example: "Italian, pizza, pasta, fine dining" → use each

**If Fitness:**
- Extract: activities, training types, services
- Example: "personal training, yoga, cardio, spa treatments" → use each

**If Education:**
- Extract: subjects, courses, exam types
- Example: "IELTS, spoken English, math tutoring" → use each

**If B2B/SaaS:**
- Extract: solutions, tools, services, use cases
- Example: "CRM software, marketing automation, SEO services" → use each

❌ ALWAYS IGNORE: marketing adjectives (premium, best, world-class), technical specs, vague features

## STEP 3: CHOOSE KEYWORD PATTERNS

Based on the business category, use these patterns:

- "plumber bangalore", "dentist whitefield", "gym koramangala", "pizza sarjapur"

**Pattern 2 (25%):** [offering] near me / [location]
- "plumber near me", "dentist near whitefield", "gym near koramangala"

**Pattern 3 (15%):** [quality] [offering] [location]

## STEP 4: LOCATION STRATEGY

- Create variations: "[offering] [area]", "[offering] near [area]", "[offering] in [area]"

**If business is ONLINE/NATIONWIDE**:
- Use primary_location only
- Focus on: "[offering] online", "[offering] india", "[offering] [primary_location]"

**If business is HYBRID**:
- Prioritize local areas (70%)
- Add online/broader terms (30%)

3. **Think like a customer** - how would THEY search?
4. **Keep it simple** - 2-3 words maximum
5. **Use all locations** - if it's a local business
