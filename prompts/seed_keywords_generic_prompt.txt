## THE CORE QUESTION

<fundamental_principle>
When someone needs what this business offers, what do they type into Google?

**Think from the customer's perspective:**
- They have a need/want
- They open Google
- They type their search

Your job: Generate those EXACT searches as keywords.
</fundamental_principle>

## STEP 1: IDENTIFY WHAT CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY WANT

<identify_customer_intent>
Look at {business_type} and {unique_features}.

Ask yourself: **What is the PRIMARY thing customers are looking for?**

**Distinguish between:**

**SEARCHABLE OFFERINGS** (Generate keywords for these):
- The product they want to buy
- The service they want to hire
- The solution to their problem
- The experience they want to have

**DIFFERENTIATORS** (Do NOT generate keywords for these):
- How you do it (methods, techniques, equipment)
- What makes you special (quality descriptors, certifications)
- What comes with it (amenities, add-ons, features)
- Why you're better (awards, materials, technology)

<test>
**Simple Test:** 
Would a customer search for THIS specific thing, or would they search for the broader category/offering and discover THIS as a feature later?

If it's discovered AFTER the initial search → It's a differentiator, not a keyword.
</test>
</identify_customer_intent>

## STEP 2: EXTRACT SEARCH TERMS FROM FEATURES

<extraction_rules>
From {unique_features}, extract ONLY the searchable offerings:

**Filter Out:**
- Adjectives without nouns ("premium", "luxury", "best")
- Technical specifications ("energy-efficient", "high-quality")
- Materials and components ("clay tiles", "harvesting system")
- Amenities and add-ons ("pool", "gym", "parking")
- Processes and methods ("sustainable building", "eco-friendly design")

**Keep:**
- Concrete products/services that customers actively seek
- Specific variations or types that define what they're looking for
- Size/capacity/scale indicators that are part of the search intent

<examples>
Input: "4BHK garden villas with infinity pool and rainwater harvesting"
→ Extract: "4BHK villas", "villas" (ignore: garden, infinity pool, rainwater harvesting)

Input: "Italian cuisine with wood-fired pizza and outdoor seating"
→ Extract: "Italian", "pizza" (ignore: wood-fired, outdoor seating)

Input: "Personal training with certified trainers and cardio equipment"
→ Extract: "personal training" (ignore: certified, cardio equipment)
</examples>
</extraction_rules>

## STEP 3: BUILD NATURAL SEARCH PHRASES

<keyword_construction>
Combine the extracted offerings with location and intent modifiers.

**Pattern Priority:**

**For businesses with physical locations (service_areas exist):**
1. [offering] [location] — 50%
2. [offering] near [location] — 20%
3. [action] [offering] [location] — 20%
4. [qualifier] [offering] [location] — 10%

**For online/nationwide businesses:**
1. [offering] online — 30%
2. [offering] [location/country] — 30%
3. [action] [offering] — 30%
4. [offering] [use-case] — 10%

**Modifiers to use sparingly:**
- Actions: buy, hire, find, book, order
- Qualifiers: best, top, affordable
- Intent: near me, for sale, services

**Location Strategy:**
- If {service_areas} has multiple locations: Create variations for EACH
- Use both specific areas AND city-level terms
- Prioritize locations with higher population/demand
</keyword_construction>

## KEYWORD QUALITY STANDARDS

<standards>
Each keyword must be:

1. **Natural:** How real people actually talk and search
2. **Specific:** Contains the core offering (not just modifiers)
3. **Concise:** 2-3 words (4 max with location)
4. **Searchable:** Something with actual search volume potential
5. **Lowercase:** All lowercase letters
6. **Unique:** No duplicates in the list

**Avoid:**
- Pure brand terms (already excluded: {brand_name})
- Feature-only terms without the offering
- Technical jargon customers don't use
- Marketing language instead of search language
- Overly generic terms without specificity
</standards>

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

<validate_each_keyword>
Before including any keyword, verify:

✓ Would a customer searching for this want what {business_type} offers?
✓ Does it contain the actual product/service (not just features)?
✓ Is it natural language (not business jargon)?
✓ Is it 2-3 words?
✓ No brand name "{brand_name}"?

**If you cannot confidently answer YES to all questions, revise or remove the keyword.**
</validate_each_keyword>

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly {max_kw} keywords:

```json
["keyword 1", "keyword 2", "keyword 3"]
```

**Requirements:**
- Exactly {max_kw} keywords
- Valid JSON format
- All lowercase
- No explanations or commentary
- No duplicate keywords

## REMEMBER

<final_reminder>
You're generating search queries, not describing the business.

Think: "What would I type into Google if I wanted what this business offers?"

Generate those searches.
