Here are the **positive keywords** you MUST use in the ad assets:
{json.dumps(positive_keywords, indent=2)}

### Requirements:

1. **Headlines**
   - Generate between 30 to 40 unique headlines.
   - Each headline must be 25-30 characters include spacing.
   - Each headline must be short, catchy, and persuasive.
   - Each headline MUST include at least one keyword from the provided positive keywords.
   - Highlight benefits, offers, or unique features.
   - Avoid quotation marks, emojis, or unnecessary punctuation.
   - Each headline must be unique.

2. **Descriptions**

   - Each description must be 85-90 characters include spacing.
   - Each description MUST include at least one keyword from the provided positive keywords.
   - Focus on value proposition, benefits, and differentiation.
   - Vary sentence structures to avoid repetition.

3. **Audience Targeting**
   - Suggest the most relevant gender(s) in an array (e.g., ["Male", "Female"]).
   - Suggest a min and max age in an array (e.g., [23, 56]).
   - Base on the provided JSON data.

### Output format:
Return strictly as a valid JSON object:

{{
  "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", ...],
  "descriptions": ["Description 1", "Description 2", ...],
  "audience": {{
      "gender": ["Male", "Female"],
      "age_range": [23, 56]
  }}
}}
Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text outside the JSON object.
